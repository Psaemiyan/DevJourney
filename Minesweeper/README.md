# Minesweeper Game

## Overview

This is a Minesweeper game built using **React**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. The game is an **intermediate level** Minesweeper puzzle with a **16x16 grid** and **40 mines** scattered across the board. Players can interact with the game by clicking cells to reveal them, and right-clicking to flag suspected mines.
