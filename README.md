This is my collection of weekly projects! The works in this repo are focused on honing my skills in web development, particularly in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Three.js. 

## Projects Included

This repository includes various projects that span different levels of complexity. Below is an overview of some key technologies used and the types of projects you will find:

- **HTML & CSS**: Layouts, responsive designs, and styling techniques.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features and DOM manipulation.

Each project is a self-contained challenge aimed at improving my front-end development skills.
